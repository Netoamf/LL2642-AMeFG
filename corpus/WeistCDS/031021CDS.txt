you know Ryan might not know this that I hadta go to a conference and you did a bunch of stuff with daddy when I was gone .
I missed Matty when I when I was gone but you guys went to a new zoo .

so you were looking at animals at the zoo .
what else did you guys do at the zoo ?
anything else ?
Boo did you guys do anything else at the zoo ?

oh .
they had blue ones huh ?
so daddy pulled you in the wagon ?

oh yeah what kind of a loud one ?
you forget ?
was it that hyena ?

so we got a little table and what's this thing here ?
a bed wow .
we got all kinds of stuff and this is a very mixed up house though .
you know what I can do ?
I can turn this house around and we can put the stuff in the rooms .
it's got some stuff in it but we can put our stuff in it .
we can make our own little house huh ?
do you want me to take this stuff out ?
and then we can put our stuff in there .
okay that's a good idea .
okay so that's gonna stay in there huh ?
hey didn't you and Daddy also go to visit the land while I was gone Matty ?
what did you guys do on the land ?
you ate some there ?
what did you eat ?
berries ?

grass ?
you did you ate grass there ?
oh .
what did you eat there ?
I think you guys did had a picnic right ?
that sounds like fun .
I like going on picnics .
that is fun .
you know I think even since we've seen Ryan we also had a holiday Easter .
I don't think we've seen Ryan since Easter .
so what'd you get for Easter Mat ?
Wild Thornberry books .
do you remember the name of all of em ?
oh_my_goodness is it another set of those ?
that is so funny now we have so many pies look at that .
who's gonna eat all these pies ?
I'm not hungry .
we have so many pies we do we have a bunch of pies .
that's really funny .
we got another toaster too ?
wow .

how many do you have in your house ?
one .
one toaster .
I have one in my house too .
yeah ours is kind of different though .
ours is a toaster oven .
so ours doesn't have like where the bread pops out right ?
sometimes they have it where the bread pops out when it's done .
ours doesn't work like that though right ?
do you like toast do you like to eat toast ?
another cookbook ?
well how many cookbooks do we have now ?
three cookbooks .
hey can I see those ?
I was tryin to think of what that was .
oh okay .
oh okay .
yeah they do .
they got a_lot_of cookbooks in this house .
it says Crisco .
they useta use that instead of butter .
so now I haven't been to your house in a long time so I was wondering how is your tortoise was doing ?
I can go get that .
is he doing pretty good ?
yeah ?
has he gotten any bigger ?
you think so ?
yup .
oh this looks like chalk ?
you think it is ?
I really don't know what that's sposta be .
a .
I know I wonder where that's sposta go in the house .
so I was asking you about Easter cause you got books for Easter .
do you remember what's one of the names of one of the books ?
do you remember ?
cats .
yup .
cats have ants bird cries wolf and remember the other one ?
drawing the line yep you remembered all the names that's good .
do you know which one is your favorite one ?
okay that's fine .
I'll try to think of which one I like best .
I think I like ah
I like cats have ants .
that's pretty weird .
really ?
there's people in there let's see .
I think those are things you can buy .
more people more people for the house if you don't have any .
they have some here right ?
there might be .
oh so you were wondering if there could be some people inside these boxes right ?
that could be .
I don't know .
looks like there's plenty of furniture and plenty of toasters .
oh and you have another fridge here .
should they have two fridges at their house ?
they must have a_lot_of food then huh ?
wow I wonder what kind of food they should have in there .
I think they should have
yeah ?
oh hockey game little thing like we have that .
but they don't have any hockey sticks right ?
where's the hockey sticks ?
what were you gonna say Ryan ?
I was gonna say that I would have a_lot_of Chewies in my refrigerator .
Chewies do we put Chewies in the fridge ?
.
where do you keep Chewies ?
oh in the cabinet oh okay .
what kind of things do we put in the fridge ?
anything ?
like the cat ?
well ?
we put our heads in there ?
what would happen to your head if you put it in the fridge ?
it would freeze up .
is there something stuck in there here let me see if I can get it out .
oh it's another box .
well how do you think we can get it out ?
some scissors ?
how_about that I turned it .
will that help a little bit ?
what ?
what's wrong with that one ?
it has tape on it ?
can I try to get it off so you don't end up ripping the box ?
let me try to take that little tape off okay .
this means I guess it's never been open huh ?
okay guess let's see what'd you guess is in here ?
a table okay .
here I took the tape off so you could check .
you think it's a couch ?
I can't see it .
oh yup .
so now how many couches are there ?
in here there's how many ?
oh_my_goodness .
wow .
that couch is on the table .
you want me to put them in ?
oh and I get to decorate them decorate the house ?
okay .
another fridge ?
wow we're gonna hafta build another house .
wow that's a_lot_of fridges .
well what room should the , should the toilet go in ?
there's not really a bathroom in this house .
where should we have people ?
in here ?
it looks like the kids' room .
is that a good place for the toilet ?
probably right in_case they hafta go in the middle of the night .
and the bathtub in the kids' room too ?
they can just get washed off quick huh ?
okay .
they can just go over there .
alright so we almost have all these things set up .
people huh ?
let's see .
wow !
people you did find them .
let's see here I think when we saw Ryan last time , you and Daddy were planning to go somewhere .
do you remember where Daddy was going to take you but then we couldn't go ?
do you remember that where Daddy was gonna take you to go swimming ?
do you remember where that was ?
you guys were gonna go to the big water park right ?
oh .
yeah but then they could not go .
so what did we do instead ?
we didn't go to the big water park where did Daddy take you ?
to what ?
to a hotel yeah .
what did you guys do at the hotel ?
you swam there too yeah .
you like swimming ?
yeah .
do you plug your nose ?
oh okay .
did ya ?
one time you sunk under the water ?
well what happened ?
well that's good .
did you get any water in your mouth ?
nope cause he grabbed you so it worked out huh .
so do you hafta where anything when you go swimming like something on your arms or something ?
no .
you do ?
you'll show me if you get it out ?
I don't remember a little turtle thing .
is it a raft or something around your waste ?
I don't think I know about this little turtle thing .
what are those ?
books cool .
oh my .
there's a_lot_of books .
okay .
I think though that this might be the last one that we should take apart okay ?
you wanna take them all out ?
well it's gonna take like Ryan hours to put them all away .
are we gonna help him put them away ?
yeah ?
okay .
we will though we hafta help him because there's gonna be too many to put away .
we don't even know maybe which boxes to put them in so I think we should probably start cleaning up pretty soon okay .
a couple more minutes .
I don't think there will be time to get all of them out honey .
we can save them for next time how_about ?
that's what I was thinking .
in fact what we can do is the one's we haven't opened yet we can set them in a special spot so we know that we haven't opened those ones .
oh that's a good idea .
maybe we can almost hide them then right ?
yeah we'll hafta hide them .
so_that Roman doesn't come and open them and stuff .
well if we hide em Roman won't find em and he won't open them cause you wanna be able to open them right ?
yep .
I wonder how many more fridges there are and how many more toasters .
are those the ones that are left then ?
okay so let's see we still have another chance to open them another time okay .
this is the last box okay so I'll hide these other two okay so we can open the other ones later .
I'll put them back way back far okay .
so which one is the last one ?
okay that's the last one .
oh so you gotta put those things in too in where ?
okay so we'll put those in .
I know but look at that .
can people use that furniture ?
all we got it it's just gotta fit right ?
that would be a funny house to go inside wouldn't it to have all the furniture everywhere ?
now where is the people gonna sit down ?
holy smokes !
let's see now these are ones that we still have yet to open .
cause they're kind of behind other things okay .
you're gonna decorate right you're gonna decide where you want all the little ones ?
okay .
oh_my_goodness .
it's a really really messy room yeah .
I wonder who's gonna hafta clean it all up .
too many things huh ?
too many things to clean up .
what if we did our own house like this ?
that's true there really is no space to walk in that room .
how might somebody sleep on that bed ?
pull themselves on huh .
they'd hafta hold on to the sides here .
I don't know .
what do you think ?
oh okay should I still put them back away ?
well we'll pick up first and then we can do something else .
you know I'm just kind of worried that they all might just crash onto the floor and then they might break .
can I grab them ?
okay should I take them gently ?
I'm just worried about the ones that are porcelain .
like the toilet and the sink thing are made out_of porcelain and they could break but I think I got the rest now .
well the toilet is in the other one .
remember we put it in the kids room ?
the sink is right here .
oh_my_goodness you got a whole other arm full huh .
lots_of couches .
where should we put the bed do you think ?
there's nothing in there okay .
it's heavy ?
oh I think I already put the couch in I think that was one I already put away .
just now I just did when I grabbed when you gave it to me .
hey how's your bedroom doing ?
didn't you get something new in your bedroom ?
how is it ?
is it pretty neat ?
tell me a little about it .
do you have dinosaurs on the wall ?
not yet ?
that sounds pretty neat .
I say a boy .
oh I was right .
I thought you were trying to trick me .
two .
okay I'll close my eyes so I don't see .
can I open them ?
there's three in there ?
how'd they all fit ?
let me see .
oh you're right .
boy they're smooshed right in there aren't they ?
they're captured yeah .
so_that actually stays in that room .
can I see how you put in the people ?
can I check ?
but they're a different set honey .
does it fit in that one maybe ?
I don't know .
they might be too big .
yeah it's too big .
now they're really captured huh ?
they're safe in there you think ?
you wanna put that away ?
thank you Matty .
oh well we still have a couple things to put away honey okay .
there's not too many left .
okay I'll leave it open now go ahead look through the house and see what still needs to be put away .
a tv ?
I see something that definitely still hasta be put away do you see ?
one thing that was a couple of things two things .
remember we were talking about em .
oh I see something too .
here's one box for one of em .
oh and I think I got the other fridge box .
hey thank you .
you know I don't know if Ryan knows that you are almost done with school .

and they took the windshield wipers off the car .

what do you think ?
take the bus ?
alright now .
