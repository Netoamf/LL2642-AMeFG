so he was playing tackle football and he hurt his leg and he hadta get some canes at the hospital .
so how did he hurt his leg anyway what happened ?
they did ?
oh no .
now how did you know about this ?
oh you saw him at the school with the canes .
and then did he tell you the story of what happened to his leg ?
oh you just noticed because he had the cane .
do you wanna eat your Chewies ?
remember we were gonna try to figure out about the shapes .
what kind of shape does he have well let's see .
these are so kind of strange .
what kind of shape do you think he is ?
remember how daddy always goes maybe I'll test em and see if they're okay .

you don't know ?
what's something you could put on this flooring and that we could play with it .
well I'll show you I had some ideas .
cause you have your rocks you also have these guys and then also maybe somebody could put some cars .
what do you think about that ?
oh cars .
why do we hafta make it stay there ?
does this help make it stay there ?
hm that's a good idea .
it's still moving ?
so what else should we do then ?
to try to make it not move .
put what ?
put glue well that's true we could glue it to the carpet that's not a bad idea .
but then it would be here forever and ever and ever .
how_about can you think of something heavy that we could put on it so it won't move ?
like that .
it's not moving ?
it is moving huh .
how_about anything else you can think of that would be very heavy ?
well maybe it doesn't matter if it moves .
well I was thinking that we could drive cars .

he may not like that .
I was wondering I was thinking that maybe you were looking very cold .
let's wrap you up .
now do you know what you look like ?
a mummy that could look like a mummy .
I thought you actually looked like a sandwich .
you know how sometimes you have a sandwich and it's all rolled up in the bread like this ?
what kind of sandwich are you ?
what kind would you wanna be ?
oh do you wanna be the sandwich that daddy eats ?
you're not sure what kind of sandwich that is ?
well that would mean that daddy's gonna come home and eat you .
is that a good idea ?
alright well do you wanna play with your rocks on here ?
just throw em like a dice ?
I'm gonna roll them on here though .
that's what I was thinking you were thinking .
I'm not throwing them cause we're rolling them .
you gotta roll them like a dice .
oh how'd that work out ?
that's five .
that looks like rolling it like a dice yeah .
that one fell off .
why did that one fall off ?
oh that one just on the edge .
I remember Matty when you were a baby you useta pretend that people were in the different lines like so these guys are in lines .
what are they in lines for ?
he broke their spot ?
cause he did he rolled right in there and these guys were like hey hey you cut in front of me go to the back of the line .
well these guys that have been here they've been waitin a long time right ?
they don't want him to go in front where should he go ?
and then that will go over there so he doesn't wanna go on the plane ?
oh okay .
the bunny's gonna go on the plane too ?
so is this the front of the line or the back of the line which one's the front ?
that's the front I see .
where are they gonna fly to ?
they're gonna fly up up up where the dinosaurs are wow .
that is very high .
we flew a plane that one plane remember where they took a magic school bus .
oh this is the magic school bus .
oh so this is the magic school bus all these guys are gonna go on the magic school bus instead of a plane ?
is that what you were thinking about ?
yes .
oh .
they're all on it so where's the magic school bus gonna go ?
well let's get the dinosaurs up then so_that they can see them all .
so these guys are coming by the dinosaurs is that what they're doing ?
whoa so what should these people do then ?
what are they doing ?
running away yeah .
these dinosaurs are like hey where did they go I'm so hungry .
&-uh oh we're gonna get them .
&-um tasty .
oh they eat little dinosaurs yeah sometimes that's what would happen the big ones would eat the little ones .

the beach is that where they were from ?
where's the other place where you get a_lot_of these rocks from ?
from the school and from the beach yep .
what is your idea with the dinosaurs ?
do that ?
so you wrapped him up ?
oh you want me to wrap you up and show daddy what you can make .
yes .
actually I don't know if I can wrap you this way .
what happens if I try to wrap you this way what happens with the material is there not enough ?
why don't you lay the other way it will wrap a little better .
let's turn it this way ?
try to think about it how did we do it the other time ?
okay is there a different way that you could lay maybe ?
and then it would fit ?
I don't know .
how_about another idea ?
would you like to be a sandwich or would you like to be a mummy ?
you wanna what ?
you wanna be like a mummy .
yes that would be like all covered up .
what were the mummies wrapped in ?
cloth .
what do the mummies do ?
scare people ?
