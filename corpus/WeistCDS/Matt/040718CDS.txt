. 











we borrowed that one time before didn't we ? 

play set we borrowed one time . 

this is the one we borrowed one time yeah . 

and we brought that back . 

that one remember you've just played with that or maybe we did borrow it . 

hm . 

I don't know . 

&=laughs . 

oh_my_goodness . 

can I see the ? 

interesting . 

&=laughs . 

woah . 

&=laughs . 

that is funny . 

you_know I was thinking Helga would think something was very funny about when we went home for the first time . 

you remember today ? 

and then <there was> we thought the snow was very crunchy . 

and what did you do ? 

in your socks &=laughs ? 

cause he'd already taken his shoes off . 

and I said 

well I was carrying all this stuff . 

and I said 

I'm not gonna put your shoes back on . 

I said 

maybe I'll carry you . 

but then if I carried you you wouldn't be able to walk in the crunchy snow either right ? 

so what did you decide to do ? 

oh in the crunchy snow in your socks . 

oo that was too funny . 

so and then when we were home and I was a little bit grouchy about something with with &-uh what did you do for me to help me ? 

a little happiness thing . 

so what did you make me ? 

&=laughs . 

all kinds of hearts . 

and what else is on there ? 

aw that's nice . 

Timmy . 

so who's Timmy ? 

it was a video called Timmy's_Special_Delivery . 

and so he thought he would name it Timmy after that right ? 

oh_my_goodness &=laughs . 

cars crashed . 

uhhuh . 

so I've been trying to think of some interesting things we've done since we've seen her in the last couple weeks . 

do you remember ? 

&-um something sort_of interesting happened when we were trying to &-um be able to invite a friend to go see Iron_Giant . 

how did that all happen ? 

uhhuh . 

right so we called them up . 

and we called up one of them . 

and then it was too late to call the other one . 

and so Matty was sad because you were afraid you wouldn't be able to go to the movie with a friend . 

but then what happened when you gotta the movie ? 

you actually sat with Roman so they were already there . 

oh wow . 

it was interesting . 

well what happened with James ? 

because 

and so at the movie theater James to try to get his attention right ? 

but he didn't even see you ? 

and then what happened during the movie ? 

I was not there . 

but &-um I had to go to this thing on campus . 

but what happened during the movie Boo ? 

yeah you just have some sticky feet there . 

so how come you decided to leave ? 

&=laughs . 

so after all that he decided to leave . 

what was the part that you said was kind_of scary I thought you told me about what happened in the movie ? 

the electricity was getting eaten ? 

oh_my_goodness . 

oh he was eating the electricity . 

mhm . 

and he was eating it . 

and then what happened ? 

mhm probably not . 

that's true because the Iron_Giant was eating it all . 

mhm . 

oh_my_goodness . 

that is very interesting . 

so when you put the web in there it makes the wheels start . 

hm . 

very cool . 

we may be stuck ? 

forever ? 

I think we'll be able to get it off . 

we'll just disconnect it . 

this reminds me of the experiments that you did last week at school . 

and then we did them at home . 

do you remember what were the experiments ? 

to see what sinks and what floats . 

so what were some things do you remember that we tried ? 

popcorn what happens with popcorn ? 

it sinks . 

it first it floats . 

mhm . 

and then what happens ? 

sinks . 

gets soggy ? 

you didn't eat it did you ? 

&=laughs . 

we tried all kinds of stuff . 

and then remember <and then we> & Daddy came home . 

and then you had him try the things too right ? 

guess first and then see what really happens in terms of floating or sinking right ? 

oh_my_goodness . 

now you and Daddy were playing with your microscope on Saturday , too . 

what kinds of things were you looking at under there ? 

the tree got eaten ? 

<what got> what ate it ? 

I think Daddy has an idea . 

what have we had that keep going in our backyard that we sometimes see in the back backyard ? 

he didn't think it was deer that ate the tree ? 

oh I thought that was what what it was . 

hm . 

so maybe it was like Godzilla or something . 

&=laughs . 

do you think ? 

uhoh . 

probably not &=laughs . 

hope not . 

you_know I am thinking there have been some other interesting things . 

like what happened today when we tried to go to school ? 

that was a interesting morning . 

mhm . 

it wasn't opened quite . 

it was a hour delay . 

oh . 

and school was open . 

but we did not know that . 

so we drove to school right ? 

and then we had to go back home . 

you definitely have quite a collection here . 

so that was kind_of &-um kind_of a little bit crazy in the morning . 

and what's woah what's going on with the roads and sidewalks everything ? 

uhhuh . 

so icy . 

woah I did not know that vehicle could fly &=laughs . 

be right back Miss_Lastname . 

&=laughs . 

so that was a weird day . 

and then yesterday was very actually a very interesting day at your school . 

something with &-um let me give you a hint a cross . 

uhhuh . 

wow . 

in front of the whole school he was holding the cross . 

yeah I thought that was pretty cool even_though I didn't get to see it . 

yeah . 

aw woah woah . 

lots_of things are getting knocked over . 

so that was kind of cool . 

Friday was a weird day too . 

remember you were supposed to go to school but then your school got canceled ? 

remember ? 

cause it was too cold . 

so you did a great job in my class . 

you wanna tell her what happened in the classroom ? 

what did you watch ? 

&=laughs Rugrats_Go_Wild . 

exactly we watched Rugrats_Go 

you watched it cause what was I doing ? 

&=laughs . 

and Matty sat very quietly during the whole class . 

I was very impressed . 

he did a great job . 

so I said 

Matty are you gonna come with me every day ? 

and what did you say ? 

&=laughs no ? 

boring ? 

&=laughs . 

but didn't we go out for lunch ? 

that was cool . 

you don't usually get have Burger_King lunch at your school . 

true ? 

nah so that's worthwhile then missing school and coming to work with me and then I get to take you to lunch . 

here . 

he's got some questions for you . 

&=imittoy_voice how did you like your school today ? 

good . 

did you see who's talking to you ? 

&=laughs . 

&=laughs . 

he says 

you must answer my questions otherwise I will nibble on your face . 

oh okay . 

alright . 

&-um I'm trying to think of what else we've been doing cause you_know we didn't really go out this weekend . 

no really cool cool places . 

&=laughs . 

oh_my_goodness now both of them are stuck . 

that thing really can't even roll at all now can it ? 

cause if these are stuck then this won't move either so you've totally trapped the wheels . 

that was pretty good . 

well we had a funny day . 

remember when we tried to go sledding ? 

at . 

& what happened then ? 

you remember ? 

&=sighs you got so snowy . 

what did Daddy do that made you super , super snowy ? 

&=gasps but he did better than that . 

he picked you up and tossed you into the snow remember ? 

that was so funny cause it was this very very very fluffy snow . 

and then all of a sudden Matty said what ? 

yeah you said 

I am so cold . 

and then all of a sudden it was like we totally had to go home right away . 

cause you were like really actually kind_of turning into a popsicle . 

pretty much . 

no I don't think so . 

I don't think so sweetie . 

maybe we'll &-um I guess you can ask Helga and see what she thinks . 

you wanna borrow that ? 

are you gonna bring it next time ? 

you'll try ? 

we'll try ? 

&=laughs . 

she may not want to let us borrow it if we only say we're gonna try . 

are you thinking we might forget ? 

how are we gonna make ourselves remember ? 

well think about how_about like let's say somebody really wants to remember something . 

what should they do ? 

<take it> write a note what ? 

I see . 

so we should write a note and then leave it where we'll remember to see the note right ? 

now I was curious if you wanted to borrow this vehicle the car thing did you also want to borrow the spider web or 

or is is that part of it ? 

or you just want the the car thing ? 

oh you want part &=laughs . 

so then only that you want to borrow the car you want to borrow the spider web too . 

mhm . 

you know what look what's happening to the spiderweb though . 

&=laughs by wrapping it up we're breaking it . 

eek . 

that's not so good &=laughs . 

hm . 

&=hums . 

I'm trying to think about some interesting ideas . 

I was actually thinking Matty . 

I didn't mention this to you . 

but I was thinking that maybe we could go to supper tonight . 

where would you wanna go ? 

what kind of toys do they have at Burger_King now ? 

they still have the engine turtles ? 

hm . 

well ? 

do you need another one of those ? 

&=laughs . 

well they might . 

what if we get the exact same one that we got last time . 

it doesn't matter . 

you'll just give it to Daddy &=laughs ? 

and he could bring it to his work or something ? 

I think you're more like &-um 

oh you want a hug . 

my remember my back is hurting Honey . 

what do you wanna do ? 

bowling's a little bit loud . 

we can't hear the tape when people bowl . 

we can play it afterwards okay ? 

what would you like to do ? 

do you wanna set up the doll house and pretend that there's a family ? 

yeah I was gonna do that . 

&=hums . 

so 

try to eat what ? 

what is it that you're thinking ? 

will try to eat this ? 

oh it's a paint set ? 

oh no we definitely don't want the baby to eat the paint . 

hm . 

put this there . 

okay . 

first you need to take that out and put that there . 

and then what ? 

put the blue chair there . 

okay . 

wait wait where are you putting the baby ? 

I can't really see . 

. 

in the crate ? 

in the toy box ? 

&=laughs . 

oh okay . 

the baby's in the toy box . 

&=laughs . 

actually let's take her out . 

where are you gonna put the baby ? 

how_about on the bed ? 

in the stroller . 

okay . 

okay . 

what if she rolls right out_of the house . 

keep her on the bench ? 

oh_my_god &=laughs . 

that would be terrible if she jumped out the window . 

that would be very , very sad . 

&=laughs . 

maybe we should always keep an adult in there with her to watch the baby . 

what do you think of that ? 

yeah . 

you'll keep the lady in there ? 

okay . 

alright she can watch the baby and sit by the window in_case the baby tries to start to jump . 

&=laughs she can get the baby right ? 

hm okay . 

the in the toy box . 

