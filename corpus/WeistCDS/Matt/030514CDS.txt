I did not know that trains were scary .
how do you know that trains needta be scared away ?
the drivers will be scared .
oh how come they will be scared ?
oh they're gonna think it's a meat eater !
then I could see why they would be scared .
you're pretending there is a slide .
is it gonna fall threw ?
you know Ryan hasn't we haven't seen Ryan since before someone came to visit us .
yeah who came to visit you again ?
you're grandma who else ?
they did ?
well that sounds like it was fun .
what were some of the things that you did with your grandma and grandpa ?
you did ?
who won ?
oh wow so you played it a_lot_of times huh ?
two times ?
okay .
yeah cause one time he won and one time grandpa won and one time he didn't win so one time grandpa didn't win so actually that is two times .
yep .
just twice they played .
what else did we do while grandma and grandpa were here ?
do you remember ?
where was one place we went ?
oh yeah ?
and Niagara on the Lake .
you remembered that name too that's right .
what did you get at Niagara on the Lake ?
there's somethin right behind you got .

wow that is pretty neat .
and you got it at Niagara on the Lake huh ?
what did we do at Niagara Falls Boo ?
you forget .
you walked and walked and walked huh ?
well some of the time you weren't walking what were you doing ?
playing in the mud yeah .
a little bit just a little bit .
I remember that .
say excuse me Boo .
so we did we had a nice time .
so what did we do some of the time when we were home with grandma and grandpa .
oh my what is that ?
can you bring that over here ?
I don't know if Ryan has ever seen that .
yeah what is that ?
what is that ?
hey I have another quick question .
what did you see at Niagara Falls ?
did you see anything that was kinda like big and was ?
Matty don't knock that over please .
we just spent a long time cleaning your room didn't we ?
you can carry that I just don't want that pushed all over the floor .
you wanna do this ?
yeah what is this over here that you got ?
I have not seen that before .
oh yeah .
let's look .
oh I see your what ?
and you see my eye too .
so let's see do you wanna do this or do you wanna play something different ?
okay let's play something different .
you wanna play with the big blocks okay that's fine .
what do you think about that ?
are you gonna bring it over here please so we can play cause otherwise Ryan would not be able to use any of them .
okay .
that's a_lot_of blocks .
I don't mind if they're dumped but are you gonna be wantin to pick em up later ?
no .
are you gonna help pick em up later ?
who put em all away before ?
you did yes you put all the blocks away before .
you need all the circles ?
well I will do it .
I dumped them so I will clean them up okay ?
some of the big ones .
hey you know I wonder if Ryan knows what we've been doing in the kitchen ?
there's this thing on the frigerator and it has little doors .
what's that for ?
&-um huh each day what ?
each day it is what ?
&-um huh the right day then what ?
you're trying to make a top ?
I know it's hard isn't it to try and lean them in like that .
so each day you gotta open a door .
what's the calendar counting down for ?
what's it until how many days until what ?
that's right .
oh .
so what happens at Christmas anyway ?
you can't do it ?
it's hard to build that on that way ?
I think it is hard to put the roof on too .
I think what'd you think about this idea ?
let's build up the sides and then we'll find like a blanket or something or a piece of paper or something for the roof .
let's try to see if we can build it up super high just on the sides and we'll put the roof on later okay ?
well then we gotta put something else .
what would be a good thing to cover the whole roof cause we gotta cover the whole thing the blocks aren't long enough to cover it .
that's okay .
there we go .
something else like what ?
do you see something else that would work ?
there's some paper in the basement yeah I don't know if I wanna go down in the basement .
what's something else that's made out_of paper though that would work ?
you see some paper up there ?
oh what's that ?
hey that works good .
