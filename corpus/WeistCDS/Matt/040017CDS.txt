I don't think I'd like that .
this is jelly .
jelly that don't look like jelly .
what does this look like instead ?
not jelly but gel ?
yeah but they're saying it's jelly not jello .
this is strawberry shortcake .
hm strawberry shortcake mix might come in a box .
but the strawberries wouldn't come in a box .
I'm not sure about that .
and here's a giant orange juice .
it's much bigger than everything else .
and that last thing I'd like some more of this .
this is corn soup .
