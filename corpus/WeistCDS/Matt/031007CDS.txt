I wasn't at Marissa's party so what did you do there ?
I triget ?
well what do you usually do at a birthday party ?
I know what you do .
eat cake .
what was the snack ?
I think it's on the table by the wagon .
this table right over here over by that little wagon .
that's a very cool ball .
birthday parties are pretty fun .
was it her birthday ?
yeah .
so at Marissa's you had a snack and then what did you guys also have ?
did you have like cookies or pie or something ?
look what you found .
should we open it up do you think ?
okay .
was it ?
you'll never know what you'll find in there huh .
that's okay .
no you didn't ?
we'll find it .
this is very interesting .
what is that ?
oh you're right .
do you want me to get it open for you ?
remember Matty we're gonna bring in that big new bookcase for your room .
won't that be cool ?
so_that you can have more books in your room .
hey look a school set in the bedroom set box .
isn't that silly ?
and we found kitchen stuff in the other box .
yeah .
that's pretty neat .
let me see what stuff is in there .

maybe .
did that hurt your mouth .
a staple .
can I see ?

okay while I get the things for you then what ?
and then you'll look for stuff ?
okay .
oh my a_lot_of stuff are you finding more of those boxes ?
hey Boo you know what ?
you found your ball .
you know what ?
you can open one more of those and then we actually gotta go home because remember we're gonna go visit our new land .
okay ?
it looks like another living room set .
isn't that funny ?
oh_my_goodness so that's a different set isn't it ?
cool another table .
these are really interesting .
I wonder .
it's weird that he bought a whole nother set of these isn't it ?
cause he has the whole doll set doesn't he ?
yep .
look at these little things .
you're gonna try to open those two ?
okay .
&-uh oh you know what ?
you hafta be real careful with the boxes okay .
cause if they get ripped it's not easy to put them all away .
what's in there ?
oh another table .
okay Boo should we help Ryan put some of these things away quick ?
quick .
quick .
quick as a what ?
what's something that goes fast ?
quick as a ?
quick as you can run .
hey that's what I was gonna say quick as Matty can run .
you know Ryan useta be a runner too .
yep .
oh I don't know if I could run as fast as you were running the other day .
you were running pretty fast .
Matty remember when we saw the other day when the hockey team won a big trophy ?
remember that ?
I'm not sure what those are for .
we watched the hockey game you know the national hockey game .
you wanna borrow that car ?
you had that idea before remember that ?
so I just really don't know if you can or not .
I kind of think that other kids gotta come in here though .
in general you know who comes in here sometimes and does work just like you do ?
who's in your class that was at our house the other day ?
Roman comes in here too so maybe Roman likes to play with that car too .
so that's why you can't really easily take it honey .
I don't know .
talk to Ryan .
well when would you bring it back ?
the next day ?
I think that would probably be okay .
I guess I see you in class .
okay he said alright Boo .
okay why don't you grab it and we'll put the rest of the stuff away .
get your popcorn okay .
let me grab your coat too .
