so he'll be curious as to what I brought you for a snack .
what is it ?
your mommy brought you a Reese's yup .
now do you know how to open that yourself ?
sometimes you wanna bite it but you can't ?
can you open it that way ?
okay I'll try .
I was just trying to think about that movie Charlotte's Web .
cause let's see there was a what kind of animals were in there ?
I think there was like a pig maybe .
and what else ?
Wilbur .
oh yeah .
who else was in there ?
what other animals ?
here I'm gonna put Ernie over here just so he doesn't end up getting stuff on him okay .
do you wanna make sure you hold it so .
I don't know if they give those names .
I don't know .
they should though right ?
what could be a what else is in it besides ducks ?
I know you really like the ducks .
can you use the paper to put it on here cause otherwise you're gonna end up with chocolate all over your hands .
remember how you useta do that ?
okay .
&-um now there's also like a really important other person in the movie not really a person .
who lives in a web ?
yeah .
well what happens with Charlotte at the end ?
oh well what happens with Charlotte in the middle ?
what does she make ?
what does she have ?
a web and what else does she have that's inside her web ?
remember ?
a word that's true she puts a word in there she puts the word humble in there right to refer to Wilbur ?
that's right she puts a word in there .
the other thing I was thinking though was remember she has a little egg sack ?
doesn't she have like a thousand babies or something ?
wow I remember that .
that is a_lot_of spiders .
more than nineteen yes .
more than seven a thousand .
it would take a long time .
yes .
mhm .
lots and lots_of spiders .
it would be a lot I couldn't it would be like filling up this whole space if all the spiders were born like this whole square would be full of spiders .
that's a_lot_of spiders .
where do they go in the movie cause I don't think Ryan's seen it for a long time ?
where do they go in the movie ?
where the rat eats everything .
where are they ?
oh so there was a rat in there in the movie too .
Templeton ?
and so he ate a_lot_of food ?
what happened to him ?
did he really ?
I bet he had a bellyache .
I think so yup .
and then you told me about what's your favorite song from that movie ?
you were singing that this morning .
I'll give you a hint .
what is that ?
that's right chin up chin up .
you were singing that this morning .
how does it go ?
I forget that song .
chin up chin up and then I forget .
I don't remember either ?
why does she sing that ?
Wilbur ?
how does it help Wilbur ?
remember how was he feeling since he had just come to that barnyard ?
yeah .
he did not know anybody and he missed Fern .
so he was lonely and she says chin up chin up .
we've been watching that one .
we borrowed it from whom ?
yes Ryan doesn't know we went to Roman and Sophie's house for breakfast .
oh what'd you have ?
the same thing as the adults .
well I'll have you guess .
was it french toast ?
was it pancakes ?
what was it ?
okay .
pancakes ?
no we didn't have pancakes .
waffles .
oh yummy .
waffles .
I got an idea what we can do .
okay .
how_about when you get your hands washed we can pretend that we are playing Little Foot okay and that this can be the great valley okay and that we we can take the dinosaur's like over there and that we gotta get to the great valley .
but now who what dinosaur should we be ?
okay cause we got
okay .
okay I like Little Foot .
okay so now you said this guy's what now ?
what is this guy ?
a duck bill ?
so he hasta be who ?
Ducky okay so I'll be Ducky .
and then do we have one that could be Sara ?
okay .
I forget what Sara looks like .
a Ceratops ?
okay .
and now who is this one ?
ooh let's move them away okay .
right we'll have them chase us okay .
and let's see what_about this guy ?
okay .
now as_soon_as you get your hands washed we can play them okay .
so you're gonna be Little Foot and I'll be Petre then .
and then we'll see who your mommy wants to be .
and then
Spike okay .
yeah look at those little spikes .
so if you could be one dinosaur what one would you be ?
Longneck ?
yeah long_necks are the kind of I think they're kind of nice .
yeah .
oh that sounds like a great idea .
oh well I think I'd like to be Petre if I could be .
is that okay ?
or do you have a different idea ?
okay I think maybe I could be Petre cause I do like him .
who are you gonna be ?
oh and who's Ryan gonna be ?
oh Ducky ?
that's kind of like Ducky .
okay now how what does he say ?
me Petre .
what what should we do ?
is this when we're just first going to the great valley ?
okay so what'd we do ?
oh no .
oh my gosh we better run .
I'm afraid of the meat eaters .
do you want these guy ?
here .
so I get to be the meat eater then ?
just for a little while ?
okay .
now what's my job do I gotta chase you ?
oh I don't know if we really have room for a chase game in here .
we probably hafta kind of stay in one spot .
let's say that maybe that you guys were sleeping and then the meat eater sneaked up on them .
okay and then they gotta see they're being sneaky cause they're going for his .
how did you know I was coming ?
good thing .
so we're hiding over here .
I'll be the meat eater if you want me .
oh yeah you can be the meat eater sure .
oh he snuck up .
there's the meat eater right there .
he's gonna eat Little Foot watch out !
you better run .
what if he said what if he was very polite and he said excuse me I'm so hungry I'm a meat eater do you mind if I nibble on your foot ?
since nobody's using him I can nibble on him ?
okay .
is he alive or dead ?
okay well thanks .
I guess I'll just eat him instead .
thank you for showing me but now I wanna eat something that's alive .
oh okay .
what's his name does he have a name ?
I'm not you want me to eat Spike ?
you're gonna sacrifice one of your friends ?
you're like oh eat Spike instead .

oh my gosh .
Spike Spike defended himself didn't he ?
now the meat eater's gone .
hey Big Bird can I eat you ?
so then they're going to the great valley what else did they run into on the way to the valley ?
the same meat eater .
okay I'm back .
now which one do I get to eat ?
oh well I don't like eating dead things .
I think I'm gonna eat you .
oh I'm so hungry !
well fine goodbye goodbye .
I'm getting away from that meat eater .
he's gonna be tricky .
look he's gonna hide behind let's say that this was that you guys were coming behind and you did not know that he was there waiting .
so like maybe this would be like big rocks right and you did not see him .
he's gonna hide .
okay then you guys are walkin by .
watch what happens .
was that sneaky ?
what happens really in the Land Before Time I ?
who gets eaten ?
who gets eaten in the Land Before Time number one ?
does anybody get eaten ?
she does not get eaten .
she might get eaten that's true .
you know I hadn't thought about that but
that's right he jumps on her and then bites off part of her back so he basically ate a piece of her right ?
you're right about that .
but Little Foot never gets eaten does he ?
no .
we don't have another Long Neck to be his mommy .
can this be ?
okay so how should we set it up ?
how does it go ?
oh Little Foot he hurt my back .
he took a bite out_of me .
do you remember the way to the Great Valley ?
what ?
he does ?
is that what he says ?
remember what he says ?
he says I don't hafta remember mom cause you'll be with me .
and she says Little Foot I can't .
and then she says something about go past the mountains that burn .
what are the mountains that burn ?
volcanos .
goodbye Little Foot have a good journey .
it could be you could paint on that side or put paper up on the other side .

I think we're done .
