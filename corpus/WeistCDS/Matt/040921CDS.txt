hopefully when we get a new president then there won't be a war anymore hopefully . 

we'll see . 

that's the nose . 

&=laughs . 

now when we go home you wanted to see if your gummy thing is done right ? 

yeah . 

how do we even make those gummy things anyway ? 

you just stick red stuff in there and they become red ? 

what what becomes red ? 

and then what do you do with it ? 

how does it become different shapes ? 

mhm . 

the little plate thing ? 

and then it comes out into different shapes ? 

well what happens if they don't come out and they're just stuck in the container ? 

oh so if it's not done today we'll just wait til tomorrow ? 

okay . 

that sounds not too bad . 

little they're little gummy things . 

so I see . 

so you chose the color to make it red ? 

I see . 

that was the only thing left . 

so what if there was a dinosaur that came to Abraham_Lincoln's house ? 

then how'd you a dinosaur ? 

you see him ? 

yeah . 

he would probably what ? 

devoid them ? 

so <you made> this is his house when he was the president . 

so if the dinosaur's came you would you say he would avoid them ? 

or do you think he would destroy them ? 

avoid them right ? 

&=laughs . 

now what would the president say ? 

you are not welcome here . 

go back to your planet . 

