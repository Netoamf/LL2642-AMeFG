where do you put them when you take em away ? 

I hide em in my plate . 


that's a great story . 

I like that . 

no , he didn't ? 

cause there's some water there . 

maybe this dinosaur ll take a bath though . 



oh no . 

oh dear . 

oh really ? 

oh wow . 

oh_my_goodness . 

so he crunched up all the leaves ? 

oh , for him to sleep on . 

to make a little bed . 

that's a good idea . 

oh , and a blanket too . 

really ? 

wow . 

so he goes to sleep ? 

oh , that's the little Allosaurus ? 

the little baby dinosaur ? 

what else do we have here ? 

there's lots_of little dinosaurs . 

I don't know what that dinosaur is . 



there's a flying dinosaur . 


it's a flying dinosaur . 

a flyin nightmare ? 





that was a great story ! 


that was the best story I've heard in a long time . 

but you just made it up , didn't you ? 

didn't you make that one up ? 

well , why don't you use a different dinosaur to tell a story . 

a new one cause there's a_lot_of dinosaurs over there . 

yeah . 

and I bet every one of those can tell a story . 

that's a good idea . 

which dinosaur should we make a story of ? 

well , let's pick out a dinosaur and see if we can make up a story about it . 

we move em away ? 

oh , wow . 



what's he gonna do ? 

he's all by himself . 



why did all the other dinosaurs go away and he stayed ? 

I don't know . 

can you tell me ? 

you don't know ? 

there must be a reason they all went away . 

did all the other dinosaurs forget him ? 



oh , okay . 

there he goes . 

