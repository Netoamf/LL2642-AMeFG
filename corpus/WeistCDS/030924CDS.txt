Raffiki remember he's the one that says to him go back go back to the group right .

I've been trying to think of what we've been doing since we've seen Ryan .
well we've been watching a movie .
remember we rented that movie and you watched it like five times ?
Charlotte's Web .
Charlotte's Web ?
I like that movie .
what's your favorite part ?
all of them me too .
yeah we watched Charlotte's Web that's actually you might have not have seen that one Ryan that's the second one .

okay maybe I haven't seen it .
that's when Charlotte already died .
but what's in the movie , who's in the movie instead of Charlotte ?
her kids .
but that one keeps falling down ?
what is Charlotte who is she ?
okay .
yep .
what does she tell Wilbur in the first movie ?
remember she sings a song ?
she says chin up chin up .
oh my gosh does she say hit yourself on the head ?
no .
chin up that's right .
gosh I am trying to think of what we've been doing well last night at the school there was an art show .
you know Ryan's probably never been to the art show what do they have at the art show ?
and what have you made that's up on the walls ?
so you made a sculpture huh ?
how did you make it ?
with paper it's a paper sculpture .
it's hiding huh ?
wow .
oh you got a lot down that time .
alright .
wow .
alright and how_about the last one .
alright .
you're pretty good at this game .
you know there's another thing that we should tell Ryan that he might like to visit .
remember at the Science Museum what do they have at that Science Museum right now ?
they do ?
now they're very interesting dinosaurs because they are not alive .
really ?
tell him what are the dinosaurs like ?
really ?
do they move ?
oh_my_goodness .
do they make noises ?
what kind of noises do they make ?
like meow and stuff like that ?
well they're not alive so how do they run ?
how do they move if they're not really alive ?
do you remember what makes them move ?
electricity yes .
so I'll tell him about one of them one of them has I'll tell him about the scariest one and you tell him about a different one okay ?
one of them has
oh you wanna tell him about one first ?
and what are the raptors doing ?
oh no .
that's the scariest one I was thinking of .
and there's one where their heads are almost gonna crash .
and then what's another one that they have ?
do you remember any other ones there Boo ?
yeah that one was very interesting .
are they big ?
are they big the dinosaurs ?
not that big ?
wasn't there another one that was not that big &-um well there's a baby , there's a baby Longneck that's kind of small .
well there was some baby duckbills .
do I remember the one that's next_to the Tyrannosaurus_Rex ?
&-uh no .
I forget .
was he the one that looked kind of like a Ankylosaurus ?
yes I remember that .
so we went to the dinosaur how many times have you been to the dinosaurs museum now ?
wow .
what else do they have at the museum ?
do they have a_lot_of stuff ?
can I give you a little hint ?
it has something there here I'll give you a hint and then you can tell Ryan .
okay let's say I wrapped you up in this but it was white clothes .
what did they have at the museum ?
mummy ?
well that's pretty neat .
how do you feel about the mummies ?
you like em ?
you know I remember one time when you dressed up as a mummy .
do you remember that ?
what did you use ?
I think so .
oh yeah do we needta cut it ?
let me see if I can get it .
oh , it's not quit open yet .
I don't know if I have any scissors in here , either .
let me try to break it real quick .
what are those that you wanna play with ?
blockies yeah .
I'm trying to remember what else we've been doing .
Daddy's been sick right so Daddy hasn't been doing much lately .
oh I know one time something we did that Ryan did not know about .
do you remember the time that we went hiking and there was all the snow and what did you do in the snow ?
remember when you walked along the whole ledge and we hadta make our own path by the trees ?
that was very cool .
oh should we do this ?
should we see if we can open it ?
cool thank you .
so where did all this snow go anyways that we had ?
I know .
do you like the snow ?
you do ?
actually you don't ?
I kind of thought you didn't so that's why I was surprised when you said you did like it .
I mean it's pretty right ?
is that what you like about it ?
but it's kind of cold .
what do we have at our house now since it's become more warm outside that are growing .
oh what color are they ?
pink .
it's sposta be a girl ?
I'm not actually sure if it is .
I don't know is she in it ?
it just shows one person .
I think this is just the one .
oh right here it shows two girls I see .
I think &-um they just got the wrong one cause I don't see any other one do you ?
I guess we can use her .
is this a girl or a boy ?
oh so we don't have a girl at all do we ?
what should we do with these blocks ?
is this can I wear this as a hat ?
oh_my_goodness .
that fits over your head pretty well .
when would this be good to have over your head do you think ?
when would you wanna protect your face ?
soccer that's a good idea .
will that protect your face ?
yeah ?
for baseball .
your voice sounds different when you're inside there doesn't it ?
it sounds like you are very far away .
it's cold out ?
oh it's cold in there ?
it's cold in there ?
come out come out !
oh it's cold on your hands .
pinball ?
do you wanna set this up again ?
okay let's put these away then so_that we are not making a big mess okay .
let's put them back .
how_about &-um you know Ryan's probably been wondering what happened to your eye .
yeah I noticed that .
what happened ?
oh .
a stick bumped it yeah .
this is enough in there ?
oh I see so that's why you thought there was a girl and a boy cause at school you have the girl and the boy .
see I just think this is a smaller set .
at school you probably have more blocks overalright ?
yeah so there's more blocks and then there's two people .
so how did a stick hit your eye ?
were you playing outside or .
oh okay .
do we still have sticks at our house inside our house now ?
oh now you can sit ?
he's learned to do so many things by himself .
I see that .
yeah .
I think that's great .
what's something that you can do all by yourself with your clothes ?
put em on yeah .
wow .
well good job buddy .
put them on and also how_about at night ?
take em off .
you're getting so big you know that .
okay .
okay .
oh , you gonna set that up ?
how do you think we should do it ?
there you go .
you got it .
oh you knocked it over like that huh .
it will get crossed ?
I'm not sure what this is for .
I think it's just for the packaging because it would be hard to put all of these in right .
cause if I put this part is in the way .
see that's very hard .
I do not know .
do you wanna try to put more on here ?
uhoh .
you know Ryan does not know about the trip we have coming up this summer when Grandma and Grandpa come .
where ?
New York City to go to New York City .
so what's gonna go on in New York City .
hit ?
our heads ?
I don't know about that .

do you know do you remember a place we might visit ?
the dark crystal ?
I don't know maybe I don't know .
it's gonna be a very fun trip though .

Charlotte ?
Charlotte's real ?
oh my I did not know that .
I thought that Charlotte
was just in a movie .
how come they don't have Charlotte soft toys ?
you got it out ?
what's this for you think ?
to play lifesavers ?
oh I think we should think of something else to do honey .
cause it doesn't seem like you are playing with anything right now .
do you wanna play with the dinosaur setup like the dinosaur guys ?
or the dollhouse ?
now we're gonna buy stuff ?
can I buy something ?
oh yeah that'd be great .
I think I actually would like to buy this guy right over here cause I like him .
I don't know if I have enough money .
how much does he cost ?
oh these are all the people for Ryan ?
I gotta go get some money though so hold on .
I hope I got enough .
okay so I do I really wanna buy him .
I don't know if I wanna buy that .
yeah I like that's a Longneck right ?
yeah I like the long_necks .
the other ones kind of scare me a little bit .
but you know I do not know how to take care of a dinosaur .
