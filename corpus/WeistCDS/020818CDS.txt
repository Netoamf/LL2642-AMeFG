it's an island , really ? 



and let's tear it off at the bottom . 



all right , let's see , where are your your markers are over here . 

are you ready ? 

oh , do you wanna paint again , instead of using markers ? 

do you think you could paint a flying head ? 

okay . 

<let me get the> let me get the , ah , water out for your water colors then . 

all right , and you can paint a flying head for Jessica . 

we we 

it's it's the 

where'd they go ? 

let me get some fresh water here . 

those are the paints ? 

oh . 

where did you get those ? 

huh ? 

you don't remember ? 

was it a present ? 



box ? 

are you gonna paint the , what it looks like , the paint box ? 

wow ! 

you want some more paint , it's hard to see , isn't it ? 

that was a splash , isn't it ? 

that's where the the paint and the water splash back at the paintbrush . 

that's a spider there . 

well , those is that one of the eyes right there ? 

yeah , mm hm , yep . 

are you painting white there ? 

yeah . 

oh , did he walk away ? 

are you still lookin for the spider ? 

I think he went to his hose house . 

those the big eyes , right ? 

that's the micro , that's the green light that says the microphone is on , isn't it ? 

the red light , that says the battery is low , if the red light's on . 

but the red light isn't on , so_that means the battery is doing really well . 

yeah , that's on . 

let's see . 

sure , let's paint the microphone . 

okay , let's see . 

<if it> if it's kinda this rectangle like this , isn't it ? 

so , should we paint a little green light ? 

put a little green circle . 

it's on , right ? 

and then a red one ? 

should we use this brush for the red one ? 

that is your brush , but I thought I'd just borrow it for the red for a minute since it was all cleaned off . 

up onto my sweater . 

it's black . 

<should we pain> should we use the black paint then ? 

okay . 

do you wanna do it , or do you want me to do it ? 

okay . 

no , it's not a brack bush , but I it will look black because we're gonna use the black paint , won't it ? 

I wonder what he would talk about if he could talk . 

a microphone for you ? 

should we give the flying head some really black eyes here ? 

right here ? 

oh yeah , sharp teeth , okay . 

now is that an eyebrow , what is that you're painting ? 

sharp teet , wow , does he have two mouths ? 

or is that just the top teeth and the bottom teeth there ? 

okay . 

all right , are we gonna do another microphone for Emma ? 

okay . 

should we paint Emma first , should we paint you first ? 

okay . 

what color Emma should we make ? 

orange , how_about an orange Emma ? 

no ? 

are you orange ? 

you're kind of orange , aren't you ? 

I mean , you're you're more orange than any any other of these colors I think . 

there's that little Emma , right , because you're very much littler than the flying head . 

well , you you are big , but you're you're big compared to the spider , but compared to this flying , you're littler than the flying head , aren't you ? 

no ? 

how big 

how big are you ? 

you're pretty big ? 

are you as big as a car ? 

I don't know where the spider went honey . 

I thought he just kinda dried up . 

what do you want ? 

he ran away . 

you want another microphone for Emma ? 

let's paint Emma's micro . 

all right , well we have Emma now , which is good . 

let's do the microphone for Emma . 

green and red . 

all right , let's do the red light first . 

well , it is kind of a rectangle , isn't it ? 

all right , here's Emma's microphone , over here . 

a rectangle with a red light . 

no , we're missing that piece of the puzzle . 

you ready for your green light ? 

okay . 

here's your green light . 

there you go . 

well , I put the red light here though , right ? 

red light , green light . 

now , do we need a cord for you ? 

all right , let's draw your cord . 

should we make a black cord , or what color cord should we make ? 

a black cord . 

we don't wanna knock your water over . 

oh , do you think it's gonna stick there ? 

I'm gonna make your cord now . 

look at this long cord , we could clip it right here . 

oh , it didn't stick . 

it didn't stick , did it it fell off . 

it's funny how the the paint sticks to the paper , but the puzzle doesn't stick to the easel , does it ? 

perfect ? 

whoa . 

well , it will look good there . 

that red puzzle piece on the red button . 

you know what , I think you'd need glue for that , wouldn't you ? 

glue is makes things stick , but paint doesn't . 

well you know what ? 

you couldn't use it like a puzzle anymore . 

you wanna glue the puzzle together , or can you just put it back where , put it back <in the> in the little rectangle ? 

I bet one of these pieces fits better than the other ones . 

all right , what should we make ? 

is that a car ? 

what's this one ? 

mm hm . 



what might happen if we don't wear a helmet ? 

something about this thing here , this head . 

you know , well , you know that mommy and daddy wear a helmet when we ride our bikes all the time . 

