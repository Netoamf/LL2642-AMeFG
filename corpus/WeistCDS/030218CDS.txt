you can do it . 

you can no you cannot .
okay if you wanna stay outside why don't we make some food out here .
you're what ?
you're playing Harry Potter .
what is this part of the Harry Potter movie .
when the what ?
wait wait wait when they mushed a girl ?
the part where they mushed a girl ?
when did they mushed a girl .
oh when they were playing Quidditch .
now tell me how did they mushed a girl ?
show me again .
oh I see she was between them right and they mushed her ?
and then what happened to the girl ?
and then she fell that's right .
what was the good part of the Quidditch match ?
when Harry Potter got the golden snitch yes .
that was a very good part of it .
so what is that ?
what could fit in there ?
you saw something that could fit in there probably ?
let's check .
well what do you think ?
nope .
what could fit in there probably ?
I have an idea .
how_about a piece of this .
some of those .
do they fit in there ?
here let me get you a better one .
here .
you know I did not really notice the thing that grandma gave you .
cool how does that work ?
what do you gotta do with that ?
what are you sposta do with that ?
what's he doing ?
it's digging some sand .
he's up on the stool ?
you just hafta go up there for a minute .
just to jump oh my !
how you gonna get back in ?
I don't know climb ?
there's your stool yep .
you can jump sure .
where you wanna jump to ?
right where the dump truck is ?
okay go ahead I'll move .
look what happened .
did you hurt your foot ?
what happened to your stool ?
I don't know .
what happened to it ?
it just broke a little bit .
you better be careful .
we don't want you to get cut on it .
I wonder why ?
we don't want you to get hurt on it .
really don't step on it anymore .
you could probably sit on it .
cause if you step on it again you could get your foot caught in there .
see check it out this could poke you .
I think we might actually hafta throw it out now .
where's your other stool didn't you have two stools ?
where's the other one ?
this one what ?
that one is right there yeah .
you can use it to dig right ?
oh okay so we could take this one down and put this one up ?
that's a great idea .
here you go .
excellent idea Boo cause now this part is not broken .
we can just throw this part out right ?
yeah .
great idea .
so now you have a stool again but don't step on it again .
you just stand on it that's what broke it before didn't it ?
so you're gonna just stand on it go that way and then come that way ?
but aren't you worried that it's gonna break again ?
hey hey I don't want him to die honey .
because he's a cute little grasshopper .
you don't hafta mush him .
there you go he's fine now .
he's gonna live in the grass now .
why he is ?
cause he wants to live in the grass .
he probably doesn't really wanna live in the sandbox anyway .
now don't jump off of it .
you can stand on it I guess .
I think that when you jumped off of it is when it had enough pressure on it to break .
so tomorrow we're going to do two very special things .
do you remember what they are ?
well one thing is in the morning when you wake up where are you gonna be now instead of a twinkle star ?
in the twinkle star room ?
you're going into twinkle star room ?
when's what gonna start ?
this ?
it's starting right now we're already doing it .
afterwards you can listen to it okay .
it is going it's just recording .
it is going right now .
why is it just recording ?
cause that's how it does it .
it's the same thing as when like Erin or Erika useta come over .
we're actually going to have a new person to come over .
do you know what his name is ?
come here I'll tell you .
his name is Ryan .
why is his name Ryan ?
it just is .
yeah .
.
he says he's doing some other things honey .
let's go see where are we going ?
just somewhere huh ?
walk where he is well we can't go all the way back there .
because he's like in the back woods .
I have no idea why he is actually .
but that's very prickly back there .
we could just look at him yes that's a good idea .
we'll just look at him but we're not going back in there .
we don't even have any shoes on .
he's gonna get all prickled up in there .
he says it's very prickly .
hey look what we found though .
pick it up .
what are those ?
oh you found some grapes in our backyard .
daddy found grapes in our yard .
that is amazing .
no no it's back too far .
we're still doing this Matty come on .
yeah .
yeah are you okay ?
run no we needta sit down to do this Matty .
we can't be all over the yard .
run ?
if we can't sit in the sandbox we're gonna hafta go inside to do it .
because we hafta stay in one spot .
we can't run all over because it won't record well .
because it can't it can't record well if we're running all over the yard .
and then we won't be able to hear it and then we hafta start all over again .
what is that ?
so we were talking about tomorrow you're gonna be a new new twinkle star .
who's gonna be in your class ?
grunk who's grunk ?
you silly one .
actually in the afternoon we're going to do something fun too .
we're gonna go canoeing .
remember we're gonna go canoeing ?
who are we going canoeing with ?
you got an idea ?
oh that's a good idea .
you have another idea .
oh no that's not a good idea .
cause you're gonna hurt that little tiny bug .
you don't wanna hurt him .
do I know where the money is let me check .
there it is .
yes .
I don't know where the little bug went .
I don't know .
cause he probably walked away or crawled .
what do you think do bugs walk or crawl ?
crawl yeah .

you padded him ?
wait you got the penny and you're gonna dig for him ?
I do see him .
do I see him all the way ?
no I can't see his face .
there he is there's Luke !
I think it's like part of his equipment to help him fly .
I think he pushes buttons on it and then he can fly and stuff .
is he gonna be able to fly right now ?
do you think he can fly right now ?
there he goes .
poor Luke what if somebody was looking for him ?
what if they were drivin around in a vehicle Luke Luke where are you Luke ?
oh there you're okay but look you're all covered with sand .
okay so this time I hide him and you gotta drive and find Luke .
you're just gonna drive over him ?
on top of him ?

cause they didn't see him okay .
there he is .
and then did they find him ?
okay so now he hadta go through a big tunnel .

they're gonna what ?
okay so they're gonna hide him and this time they're gonna see him okay .
oh you want me to hide him ?
cause that's just the truck ?
here you go .
what if Luke kinda heard him driving by and he said wait wait wait .
then do they hear him calling ?
what would Luke say when they found him ?
what ?
he's standing in the car .
he's riding .
can Luke drive this vehicle ?
does this open Matty at the top ?
