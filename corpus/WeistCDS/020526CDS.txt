
very brave horsies . 

very , very brave . 

well you , you seem to know the story . 

I've never heard this one before . 

I don't know the story either . 

can you tell it to us ? 

no ? 

I think you're making it up as it goes along . 

aren't you ? 

I don't know the story . 

you're gonna hafta tell it to us . 

you can't ? 

maybe I can help you . 

once upon a time , there was 

and their names were 

okay . 

they &~ve liked to 

they liked to play in the pasture . 

and every day they liked to eat 

what did they like to eat ? 

oh . 

they liked to eat grass . 

and every day they got thirsty and then they 

when they were very tired , they usually 

where did they do that ? 

very nice . 

oh , they're all tucked in . 

then they would go to sleep , and when they slept , what would happen ? 

wow . 

these horsies are just like us . 

now , what did the mommy always say to the baby horse ? 

no ! 

no . 

what did the mommy say to the baby horse every time ? 

go in your room . 

cause there are no 

but , the mommy horse didn't want any monsters there , did it ? 

so what did the mommy horse do ? 

she what the monsters ? 

I don't even think she needed to do that . 

I think all she did was ran over to the other stable , and the monsters got 

cause they'd never seen such a 

such a mommy horse . 

and so the monsters all disappeared , right ? 

well then the mommy hadta think about somethin else to do . 

because the baby horse became very , very brave . 

wow . 

careful . 

they were very brave . 

when she came back , the mommy horse said , you have been very , very brave . 

you are no longer afraid of the monsters . 

not anymore . 

I am very proud of you . 

the monster put what ? 

mud ? 

oh . 

those monsters aren't scary then . 

they're just messy . 

that's what'll take care of us . 

so when it was , when the the baby horse found out that it was just very dirty , it was time to 

and what happened next ? 

the mommy horse washed her . 

monstees . 

they're like , like silly little monstees . 

right . 

yeah . 

and did they go away ? 

yeah ? 

no ? 

what would make those monsters go away ? 

wow . 

oh , <is that how> is that how the monsters were fought away ? 

oh no ! 

be careful . 

okay . 

wow . 

what_about the time that the baby horse became friends with the monsters ? 

oh . 

and did they go away then ? 

no ? 

not yet ? 

what pesky monsters . 

what really , really , really pesky monsters . 

they don't get it , do they ? 

they better go . 

okay . 

well , tell me the rest of the story . 

go ahead . 

I can't believe these monsters won't leave . 

well , after a while when the monsters wouldn't go away , the mommy and the baby horse decided to ask the monsters some questions . 

and those questions were like 

what what kinda questions <did the> did the mommy horse and the baby horse have for the monsters ? 

what kind of questions ? 

what did they ask ? 

they said that they wanted to get to know these monsters , so they say , what's 

what's your name ? 

what's my name ? 

my name is big monster . 

