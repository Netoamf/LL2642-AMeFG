we need clean up on aisle seven . 

you know when we're in the grocery store and somebody calls for somebody else ? 

like that ? 

and they say , 

I need a price check on a head o lettuce . 

right ? 

because the lady at the cash register looks at the thing and it doesn't have a price on it . 

so she needs to find out how much it costs to tell us . 

that's what she uses this for . 

okay , and that's when I give you money for what I'm buying . 

