yeah , that was really cool .
did you learn about sharks ?
lots_of different fishies were in the ocean movie , huh ?
an Angel fish ?
that's a shark tooth .
wow , sharks have big teeth don't they ?
these right here are the teeth , somebody made that into a tool by putting his teeth on the sides of that .
mm , look at this tooth , this is the tooth from a prehistoric shark , like a dinosaur shark .
Megaldone , that's a big tooth .
is it ?
oh .
that's right , those are jaws , very good .
&-um hm .
this says , “that's the jaws and teeth of a Tiger Shark” .
&-um hm .
they're smaller sharks .
they got big teeth still don't they .
whose that ?
wow .
that's right , it is a Hammerhead Shark .
the eyes are more scary ?

they're all the way on the outside of the hammer .
like a hammer ?

maybe some meat .
like fishing when you put bait on the end of the hook , like a worm to catch the fish , maybe they're trying to feed it some meat .
why is there a tiger in a shark book ?
hm .
I don't know , looks like little stitches .
this says , “tigers and great whites are the top predators” .
what's a predator ?
ooh , it's a scary word .
a predator is a animal that eats other animals .
that one's beautiful .
it's called a White Spotter Bamboo Shark .
oh , is that a bottom dweller ?
I think it says it's an Angel Shark .
it looks like it would camouflage with the bottom of the ocean , doesn't it ?
with the sand ?
so nobody else can find it ?
.
&-um hm .
oh_my_goodness , look at these .

look there's that flat fishy , that flat one at the bottom of the ocean , you were right .
&-um hm .
looks like a shark is maybe hiding in there ?
can't really see .

I think it's explaining how camouflaged sharks can be .
&-um hm .
it is , this is an Ornate Woebegone .
can you see the shark in this picture ?
see if you can find it , it's hiding .
I think there's a shark in there .
yeah , I can't really tell .
it says , “where's the Tasseled Woebegone” ?
you hafta try to find it .
something like this maybe .
yeah , why is he hiding ?
he's gonna wait for someone to come to his house ?

little punching , punching a number into the shark's fin .
