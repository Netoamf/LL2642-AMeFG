where did he take him ?
the fish tank .
back at his practice .
he's a dentist .
what ?
I'm not sure I understand your question .
oh in the filter ?
cuz he wanted to make the tank dirty so the dentist would take the fish out_of the tank so he could clean the tank .
and when the fish got out_of the tank they were hoping to be able to jump into the bay .
so they could swim away and escape .
it's a little little &-um inlet of water before it reaches the ocean .
he always asks me questions about that movie .
