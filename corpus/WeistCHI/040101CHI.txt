the tent .
Daddy thought it would be cool .
dinosaur .
I told her .
I went on a big big plane .
it was about as huge as this building .
I sat there quietly .
no .
I went to a water park and a swimming place .
they were both swimming places .
they weren't that big .
they were about as big as
probably about your foot would touch the bottom of that water slide .
all the ones I could go on .
the big ones Cody went on were like bigger than the ones I went on .
the water slide was about as big as this building too .
the one that Cody went on .
it was too deep so I couldn't let me tell you something .
I could walk in the little kid's water but I couldn't walk in the big people's water .
hey this is pretty cool .
this is just like Daddy's bike .
when you're riding the motorcycle you have this up .
when you're not riding the motorcycle it's like that .
uhuh .
baby bunnies .
mhm .
I petted them .
&-uh horses .
chickens that would peck your finger .
maybe they were roosters .
they didn't have the little things that hang down like chickens do .
they had I'm sure they had goats .
there was something with horns a little bit and it would even eat dog bones .
you didn't know sheep would eat those ?
no they had a little cage .
I'm sure they were not goats cause they didn't even try to jump on us .
but they were bigger than a sheep would be .
they were about their legs were about this tall and their bodies was about maybe as big as your body .
yeah .
we were gonna take pictures in the forest .
but right away I was going to try to take a picture .
Mommy tried to fix it .
it didn't work at all .
the day that we tried using it .
a helmet .
flowers but then it broke so we're not gonna get them .
hey but I got a new magazine and I can take pictures on the computer with it .
it might even be waterproof .
new magazine and there's it had pictures you could buy stuff in there .
you could order stuff from it .
I also got another thing I thought was super super cool .
it has tools and it was almost like a leaf blower thing but it wasn't quite like a leaf blower cause it sucks up wood .
yeah .
what was I going to say ?
I think it's cool .
thank you .
it can even go up here .
it can even turn .
we went to the park .
we went to the beach and the park .
we were climbing the rocks .
we took some of it home .
remember I picked some of it up ?
remember that orange stuff when we were climbing around on the rock that we took home ?
the orange stuff ?
dirty .
dirky .
play bowling .
we had a water fight .
this is how we did it we put lots_of water in our water bottle and we squirted each_other and then the next thing I knew there was water all over my head .
because I poured water all over it .
yes and then I shivered .
.
you put them all over your head and everywhere and they talk to each_other .
they say .
let's ride the motorcycle I'm sure we can do it we've done that before .
like what you hafta do on the motorcycle is push these things down .
mhm .
garden set .
Daddy got me different parts at home .
he got me bucket and two shovels .
I mean not two shovels a rake and a shovel .

I hope not .
probably kick butt barracudas .
shark babies .
cash register .
bowling .
remember when I used one of these pins to knock them over ?
I wanna do that .
throw the ball and then after you after it hits it down you do this .
and then you do this .
okay I hit it with the pin .
I can barely see through it .
because it's going very fast and I can barely see .
barely lift it .
I'm a pin .
a pinball .
I wanna do it with the ball now .
